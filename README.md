# EV_CO2_Emission_Reduction_Analysis
The EV-CO2 % Analysis Project examines CO2 emissions from traditional vehicles vs. EVs using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. It evaluates CO2 savings, reduction percentages, and EV adoption impact across regions, manufacturers, and models. Future enhancements include forecasting CO2 reductions and EV market trends
1. Overview
The EV CO2 Analysis Project examines CO2 emissions from traditional vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) to assess their environmental impact. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, this project provides insights into CO2 savings, reduction percentages, and EV adoption trends across regions, manufacturers, and vehicle types.

2. Key Objectives
i.Compare CO2 emissions from traditional vehicles vs. EVs
ii.Calculate CO2 savings and reduction percentages
iii.Identify top manufacturers and models contributing to CO2 reduction
iv.Analyze regional CO2 savings trends.

2. Tech Stack
SQL – Data querying and analysis
Power BI – Visualization of CO2 trends
Python (Optional) – Data processing and modeling.

3. Data Insights
Average CO2 reduction per manufacturer
i.Top 5 models with highest sales and CO2 savings
ii.Total CO2 savings by region
iii.CO2 reduction percentage by vehicle type.

4. Power BI Dashboards
i.CO2 Reduction Over Time
ii.CO2 Savings by Region & Manufacturer
iii.Top Models by Sales and CO2 Reduction.
